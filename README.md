# Diabetes Detection ML Models
This project focuses on using machine learning algorithms to develop models for diabetes detection. Four different models were implemented and evaluated: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Network (NN).


## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis of diabetes can lead to better management and treatment outcomes. This project aims to provide a solution for automating the diabetes detection process using machine learning models.

## Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

- The dataset 'diabetes.csv' file is also included in this repo.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karan-panda/diabetes-detection-project-using-MLmodels.git
``` 

2. Navigate to the project directory

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Explore the model implementations and experiment with different datasets. The models are implemented in separate files for easy understanding and usage.


## Models

The project includes the following machine learning models for diabetes detection:

1. Linear Regression: A linear model that predicts the probability of diabetes based on the input features.

2. Logistic Regression: A binary classification model that estimates the probability of diabetes occurrence using logistic function.

3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric model that classifies instances based on the similarity to k nearest training samples.

4. Neural Network (NN): A deep learning model with multiple layers that learns complex patterns in the dataset to predict diabetes.
